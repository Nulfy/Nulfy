ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nulfy

My name is Dev Kapadia, and I study at Penrith Selective High School.

I like to develop a variety of programs, usually for hobbies or as small projects for school. My programs are usually written in either JS or Java.

I also play Valorant (currently Immortal 2) and used to play Bedwars (500 stars).

You can find me on all my socials as @devkapa.
